Streamflow Service Configuration
********************************

VisualVM - Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    VisualVM is a managing and profiling tool included in the Java JDK installation and can be found under the installation folder in the bin directory. The simplest is to run the application on the server itself , but with the right settings of firewall etc , you can use from a client computer.

    Streamflow is utilizing this tool for managing services and configurations.

    The executable file is **JAVA_HOME/bin/jvisualvm(.exe)** or you can download it from https://visualvm.github.io/download.html

    If you run on the server and the OS is Windows then VisualVM needs to run as Administrator. VisualVM should have rights to view Java processes that belong to the system profile . Initially, you also need to install VisualVm - MBeans plugin available under Tools / Plugin.

    Under *"Local"* you need to add a JMX connection that goes against **localhost:1099**with the administrator user.

    .. image:: images/visual_vm_1_3_6.gif
        :align: center
        :width: 100%

    Service Configuration is made on **MBeans** tab under **Qi4j/StreamflowServer/**

    On the first start we need to install the *MBean* plugin to be able to manage *Streamflow*.
    Choose Tools - Plugin on the menu bar and on the tab **Available Plugins -> VisualVM-MBeans -> Install**. Follow the install wizard.

Connect Streamflow locally on your server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Right click on Local node in the tree and add a new JMX connection.
    Provide **localhost:1099** as address and the streamflow administrator user and password.

Connect Streamflow remotely from your PC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Right click on Remote node and add a new Remote host.

    .. image:: images/visualvm_remotejmx.gif

    Right click on the new remote host and add a new JMX connection.

Manage Streamflow
*****************
    Open the JMX connection by double-clicking on the representing tree node.
    Change to the the MBeans tab and select/open the Qi4j tree node.
    All Qi4j applications running in this java process ( JVM ) will show up under the Qi4j node.

Operations
^^^^^^^^^^

backup
""""""
    If no initial event backup file exists a new event backup file is created otherwise a event diff file spanning from the last created event backup file or event backup diff file until the backup timestamp is created.

    This call makes also a backup copy of the Jdbm entity store in form of a g-zipped JSON file if there is no such file for the date when the method was called.

    A good practice is to do a backup of the data store at least after each successful Streamflow version upgrade since restore might not work properly over database version boundaries if there where structural changes involved between versions.

    If disk space becomes an issue it is advisable to empty the backup folder regularly and
    create a new fresh backup from scratch.

    The mentioned files can be found in the StreamflowServer folder under data/backup.

restore
"""""""
    Restores the Jdbm entity store from the latest backup file, restores the event store from event backup files and replays any application events from the event store that occurred between entity store backup file timestamp and now.

performArchivalCheck
""""""""""""""""""""
    This method checks for cases that can be archived according to the archival rules set up in the Streamflow administration Gui for case types.

performArchival
"""""""""""""""
    Performs a archival on cases that are due for archival according to the archival rules setup for case types. For now there is max age and archival type available as archival rules.

    That means to be an archival candidate a case must be in status closed and must have reached maximum age for it's case type.

    There are two archival types available for now - delete and export.
    Delete removes the case from the system, export creates a PDF file of the case and saves it to the archive folder in StreamflowServer/data folder as <case-id>.pdf before it removes the case from the system.

interruptArchival
"""""""""""""""""
    Interrupt a commencing archival, both manual or scheduled archival can be interrupted with this command.

refreshStatistics
"""""""""""""""""
    Empties the statistics database entirely and recreates statistics for cases in status closed from the first start of the Streamflow application.

reindex
"""""""
    Removes the RDF and Solr indices and regenerates them.
    The rdf index is for fast access to the Jdbm entity store and the solr index is for fast free text searches on case data.( i.e. case id, description, note, contacts, searchable form fields, etc.)

    RDF - Resource Description Framework, an official W3C Recommendation for Semantic Web data models
    Solr - An Apache search engine based on Lucene

exportDatabase
""""""""""""""
    Exports the Jdbm entity store to a JSON file.

importDatabase
""""""""""""""
    Imports a database into the Jdbm entity store from a JSON file.

exportEvents
""""""""""""
    Exports the events from the event store to a JSON file.

exportEventsRange
"""""""""""""""""
    Exports the events of a range of time between given from and to date.

databaseSize
""""""""""""
    Returns the amount of objects located in the Jdbm store.

.. important::
    In general services have to be restarted in order to be able to pick up configuration changes!

Archival Configuration
----------------------


.. image:: images/visual_vm_archival_config.gif
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

The archival service handles when and how cases are archived and removed or only removed from the system. The main configuration of this behavior is administrated inside the Streamflow administration GUI where you can set max age for cases of a certain case type or label before they are retired.

Archive Call Service
--------------------

Archive configuration , see **Qi4j/StreamflowServer/Application/Archival/Service/archival/Configuration**

This service is used in archival/removal of cases, ie archiving of files to pdf and removal of them, alternative only removal.

In Streamflows administration interface an administrator can specified for each case type and for each label the following:

    * Specify whether a case with a certain case type or label will be archived after a given number of days
    * Set what action to be taken, a) the saving of the case to file (pdf) and then removal of the case from Streamflow , or b) Only the removal of the case.

Background: Some cases are only interesting from a statistical standpoint, but can regularly removed from the Streamflow database Jdbm. One example can be if incoming calls to the contact center are labelled with a label "Connected call", and the label is used to remove cases in the Archival Service. One can set up cases with label "Connected call" shall be removed after an example 3 days.

It is advised that archiving/removal runs at night, after a daily complete backup. The service is such that the behaviour depends on a number of parameters, like how many cases it will handle for each activation of the operation, see Attributes below. If you havenÂ´t done case removal before, then it will take a number of times before a balance is reached, where only the difference of cases between a day and the next are removed. Therefore, one can set up the constraints on the number of cases handled per operation.

Possibly it may in some cases be necessary with a re-indexing to optimise the index after extensive archiving / removal.

On the server there are a number of log files, including the one that begin with " streamflow ... " , see below. The streamflow log file can be investigated to see the outcome of the operations. The last activity is at the end of the file. Activities are time stamped.

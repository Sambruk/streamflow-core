= Wiki =

Welcome to the example *static wiki*.

== How to customize? ==

You can customize this wiki by editing the file:///_statwiki.config file.

For start, edit the title, slogan and other visual parameters of the wiki pages. Open the config file using your favorite text editor and find the `[generator]` section. This section contains settings for the _HTML generator_ which builds the HTML around the _wikitext_ processed by StatWiki.

The explanation of all available generator settings can be found in the generator itself (the file:///template/generator.py file in the `template` subdirectory).

After you're done, save the configuration file and rebuild your wiki by running StatWiki with the `--build` option. This is needed so that the title and other static objects are updated on all pages.

== Search bar ==

You can enable a search bar on the top of the page. To do that, create a _Custom Search Engine_ using Google's service available at:

http://www.google.com/cse

You should configure it to only search the wiki pages by setting the domain your wiki is available at. A final step is to go to the Google's search bar settings, then to the _Code_ tab and copy the *value* attribute from the following line:

{{{
<input type="hidden" name="cx" value="">
}}}

Paste it into the `cse_id` setting in the `[generator]` section of the wiki config file. Rebuild the wiki. Done.
